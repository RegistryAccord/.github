# Code of Conduct

This is the canonical Code of Conduct for the RegistryAccord (RA) project and applies to all RA repositories, discussions, events, and community spaces. Other RA repos should link to this file rather than duplicating it.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to a welcoming, safe, and inclusive environment where collaboration, learning, and constructive disagreement can thrive.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful, considerate, and empathetic.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Using inclusive language and offering help to those who ask.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments and jokes.
- Threats or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Trolling, insults, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption.
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities

- Community members are responsible for clarifying and upholding the standards of acceptable behavior.
- Maintainers are responsible for reviewing reported incidents, enforcing this Code of Conduct, and communicating reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
- Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub organizations and repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, forums, chat channels, and during any public events where an individual is representing the project. Representation may be explicit (e.g., official accounts) or implied (e.g., wearing project-branded clothing at an event).

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, report it to the project team at:

- Email: info@registryaccord.com

When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information.
- Names or handles of the individuals involved.
- When and where the incident occurred (links, timestamps, or context).
- A description of what happened and any supporting evidence (messages, screenshots).
- Any additional context you believe is relevant.

Reports will be handled promptly, respectfully, and as confidentially as possible. The project team may request additional information to aid investigation.

## Enforcement

- After reviewing a report, maintainers will determine appropriate action. Possible actions include: a private warning, content removal, temporary moderation (e.g., limited interaction), temporary ban, or permanent ban.
- The project team will consider the severity, recurrence, and intent when determining consequences.
- Whenever possible, the enforcement decision and rationale will be documented for transparency, while protecting reporter confidentiality.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The following guidelines describe how the community typically enforces this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction  
   - Community impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
   - Consequence: A private, written warning with clarity around expected behavior.

2. Warning  
   - Community impact: A single incident or series of actions that violate the standards.  
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior, which may include temporary moderation measures.

3. Temporary Ban  
   - Community impact: A serious violation of community standards, sustained inappropriate behavior, or repeated violations.  
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.

4. Permanent Ban  
   - Community impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, or an egregious breach of trust.  
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

The project team may adjust these responses based on context and severity.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement decision was made in error or without sufficient context, you may appeal by replying to the original decision notice or emailing info@registryaccord.com with additional information. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved in the initial decision when possible.

## Conflicts of Interest

If a report involves a maintainer, that maintainer will recuse themselves from the enforcement process for that incident. If all maintainers are implicated, an external advisor or neutral community members may be invited to help review.

## Amendments

This Code of Conduct may be amended through the project’s governance and RFC processes. Changes will be documented and dated within version control. All participating repositories should link to this file to ensure a single source of truth.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct draws on widely adopted community standards and industry practices, adapted for the needs of the RegistryAccord project.
